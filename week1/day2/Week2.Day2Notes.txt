    Data Types

    Variable -> a placeholder for a value 
    Data Type -> specifies which type of value a variable can hold

    To define a variable
        1. Declaration -  int  age   
        2. Assignment -   age = 25;
        3. Initialization - int age = 25;

    datatype  variableName = value;
    variableName - camelCase
    numOfYears - camelCase
    NumOfYears - PascalCase


    Operators
        = --> Assignment operator that assigns the value to your variable
    1. Arithmetic Operators
        Addition:  +      25+5 = 30
        Subtraction: -    25-5 = 20
        Multiplication: * 25*5 = 125
        Division: /       25/5 = 5  Quotient
        Modulus: %        25%5 = 0  Remainder
                          25%3 = 1 
    2. Comparison Operators - used to compare the values
        equal to       ==   25 == 5 -->false
        not equal to   !=   25!=5 --> true
        greater than   >    25>5 --> true
        greater than equal  >=   25>=25 --> true
        less than      <    5<25 --> true
        less than or equal  <=   5<=25 ---> true


Control Statements
If else 
    the execution of your program is based on the condition - whether it is true or false

    Traffic Light - red, yellow, greeen
     if (traffic light is red)
            Stop your vehicle

    if (traffic light is yellow)
        Slow down your vehicle
    
     if (traffic light is green)
        Move


for loop
  for(int Initialization; condition; increment ){

    syso()
  }

  for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){

    print("5");
    incrementation                     O/P 5
  }
