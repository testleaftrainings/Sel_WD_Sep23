Today's Agenda:
---------------
9.30AM to 10.15AM   -Cucumber Parametrization 
10.15AM to 10.30AM  -Classroom
10.30AM to 11.30AM  -Hooks implementation
10.30aM to 11.50AM  -classroom
11.50AM to 12.00PM  -Break
12.00PM to 12.20PM  -Tags
12.20PM to 12.30PM  -Live quiz


Scenario Outline and Examples


Create a feature file for createlead feature
Use the keyword -Scenario outline
Write the scenario for the create lead
Use <> to parametrize the testdata in the required step
Use the keyword Examples: to pass multiple set of data
|| -->header
|''|-->values
Under Login.java
 Create methods to map the feature step with implementation codes
 
 In Runner  -->set the path for create lead feature glue with stepDefinition package

Common funtionalities:

Background-->common funtionalities 
 -->will used to group the common funtionalities only with in the feature file (between the scenarios in the single feature file)

Hooks Implementation:
--------------------
java code
Cucumber annotation 
@Before
@After 


Moved common steps into Hooks class and Comment all the lines of code in java class
 using preCondition and postCondition and annotated the methods with @Before and @After
 comment the Backgound steps 
 
 
 BaseClass-->driver as global variable -->instatiated in Hooks class -->inherits baseClass
 Login and Creadlead class -->inherits ->baseClass
 Hooks Implementation
 --------------------
 Create 2 classes 
  Baseclass -->driver variable declared as static global
  HooksClass->Create methods as pre and post condition and annotate with @Before and After
  extend class with BaseClass
  In Login -->remove the common methods (launch browser and loadUrl) and extend the class with Baseclass
  In Login Feature -->comment the common feature steps
  
  
  
  Runner extends Baseclass
 
  BaseClass extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTest 
   Move the Pre and Post Condition steps to BaseClass using TestNg annotation @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod
 
 
 tags -->attribute of @CucumberOptions
