Introduction to Extent report
POM with Extent Report
Automation challenges

Extent Report:
-------------
 Third party library -->Avenstack
  -->html 
 Pictorial represtation /visual representation of the status/ summmary of execution
Pre-Condition: Add ExtentReport maven dependency in pom.xml
Steps to integrate ExtentReport with POM:
-----------------------------------------
1. Create startReport() method in BaseClass with @BeforeSuite annotation
	- Add step1 to step3 ExtentReport code
	- Declare ExtentReports as global variable with static access modifier
	
2. Create testDetails() in BaseClass with @BeforeClass as annotation
	- Add testcase details code into the method
	- Declare the ExtentTest as global variable with static access modifier
	
3. Declare global variables testName, testDescription, testCategory, testAuthor and replace the hardcoded value with these variables	

4. Create stopReport() in BaseClass with @AfterSuite
	- add extent.flush()
	
5. Create reportStep() in BaseClass with 2 arguments (stepInfo, status)	
	- Conditional statement to call appropriate method for pass and fail status
	
6. Call reportStep() from page methods
		- from try block, call with pass status
		- from catch block call with fail status
		
7. Create takeSnap() in BaseClass with necessary code to take snapshot with filename appending with Random number
		- add return statement to give random number as output 
		
8. Call takeSnap() from reportStep() to attach the image to the steps
